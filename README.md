This is a faster alternative to an AHK macro for the game Destiny 2.

For this program to work at the moment please have your alt keybind set to this:

Pbox:
For Ride Sparrow: N // remember alt keybind

Fusion Breach: //needed for Fusion Breach to Work. This will be fixed later to allow for customization. 
For Grenade: Q // only need for fusion breach, will be fixed to get your grenade keybind later.
For Dodge Right: Q
